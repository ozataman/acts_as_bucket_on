ActsAsBucketOn
==============

This is a plugin created out of practical necessity to form groupings, a.k.a. buckets, from the results of a query.

The plugin currently has only minimal functionality, but it works. I plan to add and expand on the idea, as this is
much needed functionality in many applications.

Please feel free to suggest ideas, provide feedback or complain at:

Example
=======

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_bucket_on :horizon, :conditions => "self.due_at.strftime('%y%m%d')"
end

@tasks = Task.all
@buckets = Task.bucket_by_horizon(@tasks) # => {'20090305' => [<Task>,<Task>,...], '20090306' => [...]}
	
Now you can easily list tasks from each day separately in your views without having to apply any further processing on them:

<% @buckets.keys.each do |key| %>
<h1>Tasks due <%= @buckets[key].first.due_at %></h1>
.
.
.
<% end %>
